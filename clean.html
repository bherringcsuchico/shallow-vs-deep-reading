  <h2>The Invention of the Printing Press</h2>
  <p>In the mid-15th century, Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany, transformed human communication with the invention of the movable type printing press. Prior to Gutenberg, books in Europe were copied by hand, often by monks in monasteries. This process was slow, expensive, and limited literacy to a tiny elite.</p>
  <p>Gutenberg’s key innovation was the development of individual metal letters that could be arranged, inked, and pressed onto paper. Once a page was printed, the type could be rearranged to print new pages. This reduced the cost of producing books dramatically and increased the speed at which information could be spread.</p>
  <p>The Gutenberg Bible, completed around 1455, was among the first major books printed using this technology. It demonstrated the power of the press to reproduce long works with uniform quality. Estimates suggest about 180 copies were produced, some on paper and some on vellum, far more than could have been copied by hand in the same time frame.</p>
  <p>The effects of the printing press rippled across Europe. Literacy rates rose as books became more affordable. Scholars could exchange ideas more easily, accelerating the Renaissance. Religious reformers such as Martin Luther used the press to spread pamphlets and vernacular Bibles, fueling the Protestant Reformation beginning in 1517. Political ideas also circulated more widely, eventually supporting movements like the Enlightenment and modern democracy.</p>
  <p>By 1500, printing presses had spread to more than 200 cities across Europe, producing millions of books. The press became a cornerstone of modern knowledge economies, laying the foundation for newspapers, scientific journals, and mass education. Among the first printed materials were not only religious texts but also maps and scientific diagrams, which made exploration and science more accessible.</p>
  <p>The first printed newspapers appeared in the early 1600s, further transforming how information spread. The printing press also helped standardize spelling and grammar, since printed books reached wider audiences than handwritten manuscripts. This shift supported the development of national languages.</p>
  <p>Gutenberg’s invention is often ranked alongside the wheel, electricity, and the internet as one of the most transformative technologies in history. It reshaped not only how information was shared, but also how people thought about authority, religion, science, and government.</p>
